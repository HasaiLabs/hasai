# what is Hasai

Hasai aims to become the first decentralized, dual-rate NFT lending protocol that applies to all NFT collections and provides a one-stop comprehensive solution for NFT market liquidity issues. 

Hasai provides Peer-to-Pool model lending services to all NFT collections, while also promoting the financialization of NFTs by allowing NFT creators to create their own lending pools, with a robust token governance and economic model.

Hasai is unique in that its solution provides lending pools for all levels of NFT collections and is not limited to blue-chip NFT projects.

#### work flow

- user deposit nft(should be in our support list) to Hasai to get eth, once we get the NFT price through our self Oracle, we will get the nft from user and send ETH to user account.

- user can repay NFT anytime just need in valid borrow period. once user repay the nft, Hasai will send the nft to user account. if borrow-relationship is expired, everyone can liquidate the expired nft to start bid. bid period is 24 hours, each bid will increase bid period 1 hour. after bid end, the winner can claim the nft. if no one create a bid for the nft, we can withdraw the nft to sold


#### more

- each nft series has different borrow rate, period and apr.
- we will provide start liquidity
